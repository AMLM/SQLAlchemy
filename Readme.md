## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a Hawaii climate database, through  SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Find the most recent date in the data set.

* Using this date, retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data. **Note** you do not pass in the date as a variable to your query.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

* Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station id has the highest number of observations?

  * Using the most active station id, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature.

  * Hint: You will need to use a function such as `func.min`, `func.max`, `func.avg`, and `func.count` in your queries.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.
